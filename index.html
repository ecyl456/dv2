            Education plays a significant role in society in socioeconomic factors, specifically that which surrounds
            employment and income. This visualisation explores factors such as unemployment and gross national
            income,
            as well as education rates across the world. Using these trends, we seek to derive a pattern across
            different
            socioeconomic factors, and how the employability and income of a population may have a correlation to each
            factor.
